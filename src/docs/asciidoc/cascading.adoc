== Cascading

=== Stylesheet origin

Where the stylesheet comes from. The priority is:

[ditaa]
....
 +-------------------+ greater +--------------------+
 |        (1)        +-------->|         (2)        |
 | Author stylesheet |         |  Agent stylesheets |
 +---------+---------+         +--------------------+
....

=== Selector Specificity

Denotes which selectors take precedence over which. There is a
priority hierarchy:

[ditaa]
....
 +---------+ greater +-----------+ greater +---------+
 |   (1)   +-------->|    (2)    +-------->|   (3)   |
 |   IDs   |         |  Classes  |         |   Tags  |
 +---------+         +-----------+         +---------+
....

NOTE: Pseudo-class selectors such as `:hover` or attribute selectors
such as `type="input"` have the same specificity as a class selector

NOTE: `*` and combinators `>`, `+`, `~` have no effect on specificity

=== Source order

Is the order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet. Given the
same specificity the later styles override earlier styles.

=== Sum up

- Don't use IDs in your selector
- Don't use `!important`
